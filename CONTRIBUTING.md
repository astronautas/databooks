# Contributing

We are always looking for contributions! You can find below some relevant information and
standards for `databooks`.

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

After cloning the [repo](https://github.com/datarootsio/databooks/), make sure to set up
the environment.

### Environment and Package Management üìú

You can set up the environment for development by installing the necessary dependencies
using pip.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]" # installs prod and dev dependencies
```

#### Usage

Remember to use your virtual environment with the `dev` dependencies installed. For
example, if you want to create the coverage report you could run

```bash
pytest --cov=databooks tests/
```

## Development üõ†

We welcome new features, bugfixes or enhancements (whether on code or docs). There are a
few standards we adhere to, that are required for new features.

### Mypy

We use type hints! Not only that, they are enforced and checked (with
[Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)). This is actually the reason
for supporting Python 3.8+. There are a couple of reasons for using type hints, mainly:

1. Better code coverage (avoid errors during runtime)
2. Improve code understanding
3. As `databooks` uses both [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and
[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/), types are not only for developer hints,
but they are also used to cast notebook (JSON) values to the correct types as well as
user inputs in the CLI

If you are not familiar with type hints and Mypy, a good starting point is watching the
[Type-checked Python in the real world - PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMgmKJyWKn8)
talk.

### Linting

In regards to code quality, we use a couple of linting tools to maintain the same "style"
and uphold to the same standards. For that, we use:

1. [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting
2. [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for imports
3. [Flake8](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for style enforcement

## Docs üìö

As for documentation, the `databooks` documentation "lives" both on the code itself and
supporting documentation (markdown) files.

### Code

Code docs include annotating [type hints](#mypy) as well as function docstrings. For
that, we use the [reStructuredText](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/) -like
format.

Providing docstrings not only give a clear way to document the code, but it is also
picked up by [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

### MkDocs

[`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) gives a simple way to write markdown files that get
rendered as HTML (under a certain theme) and served as documentation. We use `MkDocs`
with different extensions. We use [`mkdocstrings`](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/) to
link function docstrings with the existing documentation.

You can check the generation of documentation by running from the project root

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

### mike

We also use the [`mike`](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) plugin in `MkDocs` to publish
and keep different versions of documentation.

### Cog

We use [`cog`](https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog) to dynamically generate parts of the
documentation. That way, code changes trigger markdown changes as well.

### Pre-commit

[`Pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) is the tool that automates everything, eases the
workflow and run checks in CI/CD. It's highly recommended installing `pre-commit` and the
hooks during development.

## Tests üó≥

We use unit tests to ensure that our package works as expected. We use
[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) for testing and
[`Pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for checking how much of
the code is covered in our tests.

The tests should mimic the package directory structure. The tests are also written to
serve as an example of how to use the classes and methods and expected outputs.

The coverage is also added to the documentation. For that we use
[`MkDocs Coverage Plugin`](https://pawamoy.github.io/mkdocs-coverage/). For that we need
a `htmlcov/` directory that is generated by `Pytest-cov` by running from the project
root

```bash
pytest --cov-report html --cov=databooks tests/
```

## Publishing

Publishing is automatically done via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
to PyPI. After published, a new tag and release are created. A new docs version is also
published if all previous steps are successful.

## Contributors üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª

`databooks` was created by [Murilo Cunha](https://github.com/murilo-cunha), and is
maintained by [dataroots](https://github.com/datarootsio).
