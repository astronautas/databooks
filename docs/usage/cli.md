# CLI tool

The most straightforward way is to use it in the terminal, whenever desired. It's the
default way of running the commands and how you've probably seen `databooks` being used
before. However, that can be error-prone and have "dirty" notebooks in your git repo.
Check [CLI documentation](../CLI) for more information.

A safer alternative is to automate this step, by setting up CI in your repo or
pre-commit hooks.
