# CLI tool

The most straightforward way to start using databooks is by using the terminal. It's the
default way of running the commands and how you've probably seen `databooks` being used
before. However, using the terminal can be error-prone and result in "dirty" notebooks
in your git repo. Check [CLI documentation](../CLI) for more information.

A safer alternative is to automate your databooks commands, by setting up CI in your
repo or pre-commit hooks.
